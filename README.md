# Test Gettext Lang

The script will allow you to test quickly, debugging easily and much easier than with pH7CMS if Gettext is correctly installed.


## Prerequisites

* PHP 5.4 or higher
* Gettext properly installed
    * `sudo apt-get install gettext` (Debian / Ubuntu)
    * `sudo apt-get install php-gettext` (Debian / Ubuntu)
    * `sudo apt-get install locales` (Debian / Ubuntu)


## How It Works?

In a lot of cases, Gettext won't work for some reason (and this is not caused by pH7CMS!) To check if it is correctly installed or to debug if Gettext is not working, please play with this script.

In most cases when it failed, it means the OS (the system of the server) doesn't recognised the locale set by Gettext.
